# A_way

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0.

A_way is a Travel application that lets you meet others who love to adventure as much as you do!

A_way aims to connect users with other users who have the same travel style as them and plan and track trips together. 

If you current style is backpacking through thailand in boardshorts or staying at 5 star hotels in Paris we will connect you with others so you don't have to go it alone. 

Life is too short to be a lone wolf.
